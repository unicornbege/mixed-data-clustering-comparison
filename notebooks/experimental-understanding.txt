# Data Understanding

This notebook provides an initial exploration of two datasets used in the mixed-data clustering comparison.

Students Social Media Addiction dataset: 
this dataset contains a mixed-datatype with in numerical and categorical data type. differences dominant atribute in this dataset is numerical data-type.

Viral Social Media Trends:
this dataset contains a mixed-datatype with in numerical and categorical data type. differences dominant atribute in this dataset is categorical data-type.

# Experiment with k-means and k-modes algorithm

this experiment do clustering in mixed-datatype with basic algorithm, which is this algorithm can only proses clustering in one data-type.
what i am actually do?
see characteristic kmeans and kmodes algorithm to do clustering in mixed-data type
